            <p>The term ‘aviation’ is most commonly used to describe mechanical air transportation, 
                which is carried out using an aircraft.The two main types of aircraft are aeroplanes and helicopters,
                but most modern definitions of the word ‘aviation’ extend beyond this to include the use of unmanned aircraft, such as drones.
                The aviation industry encompasses almost all aspects of air travel and the activities that help to facilitate it.
                This means it includes the entire airline industry, aircraft manufacturing,research companies, military aviation, and much more.
